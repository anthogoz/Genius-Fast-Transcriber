# 🚧 Roadmap & Ideas

The project is now mature and functional! 🎉

## 🚨 Current Priority
- **Code Modularization**: The `content.js` file has become very large. The main goal is to split it into multiple modules to facilitate maintenance and future contributions.

## 💡 Call to the Community
We no longer have a fixed list of features to implement.
**Do not hesitate to propose YOUR own ideas!**
Whether it's a small improvement, a new shortcut, or a revolutionary feature, open an Issue or a Pull Request. The project evolves thanks to you.
